## Installations

- rvm.io
- `command curl -sSL https://rvm.io/mpapis.asc | gpg --import -`
- `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`

## Install ruby

- rvm install ruby-2.3.3
 
## Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB)

- `irb`

- variables not need to be define just declared

- to know the var type `variable.class`

- see method of the class `String.public_methods.sort`

```rb
String.superclass.superclass
10.class
100.abs
```


### defining method

```rb
def double(val); val * 2; end

double(10); => 20
double("abc"); => "abcabc"
double([1,2,3]); => [1,2,3,1,2,3]

```

- cause of duck type and the custom operating implementation in this string class, this method also works on strings

-`_` stores the result of the last evaluated expression

## IDE options

- RubyMine -> jetbrains.com/ruby
- Aptana Studio -> aptana.com

## Variables

```rb
lander_count = 0
result = nil
result.nil? returns true

a = " asd "
a.strip returns "asd"
a.strip! to change the value in place

```
### To change the value in place

```rb
a = " asd "
a.strip!
#a now = "asd"
```

### Methods
- returns the value of the last expression so no need to return statement
```rb
def double(val)
    val * 2
end
```

- variables are local in the scope unless you defined as global `$log_level = "debug"`

## Flow Control, Operators, comments

### IF

```rb
lander_count = 11

if lander_count > 0
    puts "a"
else 
    puts "b"
end
```
- also can be done like
```rb
lander_count = 11

message = if lander_count > 0
    "a"
else 
    "b"
end

puts message
```

### Read from console

```rb
print "Enter your name"
name = gets
puts "Your name is" + name
```

### System

```rb
puts "Using backticks:"
res = %x(time /t)
puts res

puts "Using system:"
res = system "time /t"
puts res
```

## Classes And Objects


### Classes

- class names start with a capital letter and use CamelCase
- captalize abbreviations: XMLParser, JSONRequest


```rb
class Spaceship
end

```

####instaciate

- avoid params if there are no arguments
```rb
ship = Spaceship.new
```

## Objects vs Variables

### Creating Classes and Objects
- most thins in ruby are objects
- variables are just labels for objects
- label referencia al objeto

```rb
a = "abc"
b = a
a.upcase!
a => "ABC"
b => "ABC"
```

#### check object id identifier

```rb
a.object_id
b.object_id
```

#### clone an object
- a and b refers to diferent objects
- does not perform deep copy 
```rb
b = a.clone
```

### Instance Variables and Methods

#### Instance variables:

- denoted with @
- each instance of the spaceshit class is going to have its own copy of destination

```rb
class Spaceship
    def launch(destination)
        #go towards destination
    end
end
```

- example

```rb
class Spaceship
    def launch(destination)
        #go towards destination
    end
end

ship = Spaceship.new
ship.launch("Earth")
puts ship.inspect
#p ship (works the same)
```

- all instance variables in ruby are not visible outside of the class
