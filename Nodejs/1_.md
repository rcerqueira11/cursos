## What is node?

- Its a javascript runtime that use the v8 engine
- v8 engine is an open source javascript engine writen in c++ that takes javascript code and compile it to machine code 

## Instalation 

1. Install nvm 

can run from terminal 

	```bash
	sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev
	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
	```
2. Restart the closing or runing the following command

	```bash
	source ./bashrc 
	```
3. Install the node version that you want
	- `nvm ls-remote` to see the versions
	- `nvm install 9.2.0` to install the version
	- `nvm use 9.2.0` to use a specific version
	- `nvm current` to see the current version

4. run `node` in the console to open a python like console to run node comands

	- In the browser we have `window` that have all the variables and information, in node instead we have `global`
	- In the browser we have `document` that store a reference of the dom, in node there is no dom but we have `process` where we can see a lot of process that are being executed

5. run `process.exit(0);` to exit node console 

## Example

- Blocking

	```js
	var getUserSync = require('./getUserSync');

	var user1 = getUserSync('123');
	console.log("user1",user1);

	var user2 = getUserSync('321');
	console.log("user2",user2);

	var sum = 1 + 2
	console.log('the sum is ' + sum);
	```
	1. 3s waiting for user 1
	2. 0.1s printing user 1
	3. 3s waiting for user 2
	4. 0.1s printing user 2
	5. 0.1 printing sum
- non-Blocking
	- Event loop to make things faster
	- let us run one or more operations at the time 	
	```js

	var getUser = require('./getUser');

	getUser('123',function(user1){
		console.log("user1",user1);
	});
	getUser('321',function(user2){
		console.log("user2",user2);
	});

	var sum = 1 + 2
	console.log('the sum is ' + sum);
	```
	1. 0.1 Starting getuser for user 1
	5. 0.1 printing sum
	3. 0.1 Starting getuser for user 2
	2. wait-3s in parallel 0.1 printing user 1
	4. wait-3s in parallel 0.1 printing user 2

- `www.npmjs.com` finding `node modules`

## Require
- let us load modules that come with the J.S

	- ttp module for web servers
	- fs module that let us acces the file system of our machine

- to load third party libraries 
	- express
	- sequalize

- require to require or own files

> app.js where the application start, inicialization file for our application

- `nodejs.org/api` : to see the list of build in modules 

> OS module, to fetch username of the currently logged in user

-  require just receive one argument and is a string, with the name of the module you want to use
	- `const fs = require('fs')`

- write in a new file 
	- `fs.appendFileSync('greetings.txt', 'Hello World');`


## Add exports

- all files have module
- `module.exports.somethingNew = value`

- access `exportVar.somethingNew`

## npm init

- create a single file in the root of your project package.js

- package name: (notes-node) 
- version: (1.0.0) 
- description: 
- entry point: (app.js) 
- test command: 
- git repository: 
- keywords: for publishing the module 



- npm install package --save
	- this update the package.json file

	- lodash import as _ 

- node search for core modules if not then for modules in node_modules 

- _.uniq from lodash takes an array ad remove all the duplicate elements

## automatically update node file when saving

- `nodemon` will be watching our app and restarting every time a change occur

- npm install nodemon -g
	- -g stands for global 
	- will install it where node live in the machine 

## Input of the user 

- dynamic use input
- socket IO: real time from our web app

- access command lines your app was initialized with it `process.argv`

### passing the title

- `node app.js remove --title="asd"`
- `node app.js remove --title=asd`
- `node app.js remove --title asd`

### simplify inputs with yargs

- returns an object `const argv = yargs.argv;`

## Work with json

### stringify
- `JSON.stringify(obj)`: returns the json stringify version of the obj (an string)

## parse jsonfy
- `JSON.parse(stringToParse)`: converts an string in a json object (if it have the format)
	- `var personString = '{"name": "Ricardo", "age": 25}';`

### js module 
- write in file `fs.writeFileSync('notes.json', originalNoteString);`
- read in file 'fs.readFileSync(notes.json)'

### filter
- `notes.filter((note) => {...})`: gets a call back for each note
	- you can return true or false
	- if its true it will keep the value in the array
	- if its false the new array wont have that item inside of it 
- valid in ES6 ` notes.filter((note) => note.title === title);`

## Debugging

### command line

- `node inspect file.js`

- `list(numLines)`: to see the number of lines 

- `n`: move to the next step

- `c`: run until the program completes

- `repl`: to enter to console mode (read, evaluate, print, loop)
	- to play with the app in the current time where repl was called
	- if we make changes here we can continue with the changes

- `debugger`: use this in the code, we can use `c` to get to the debugger in the code

- can use `nodemon inspect file.js`
	- when make a change and save it will restart the debugger

### chorme devtools

- `node --inspect-brk file.js`

- see it in `chrome://inspect/`
	- `Open dedicated DevTools for Node`

- values can be changed between runing the program and the end of it
