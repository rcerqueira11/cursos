## What is node?

- Its a javascript runtime that use the v8 engine
- v8 engine is an open source javascript engine writen in c++ that takes javascript code and compile it to machine code 

## Instalation 

1. Install nvm 

can run from terminal 

	```bash
	sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev
	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
	```
2. Restart the closing or runing the following command

	```bash
	source ./bashrc 
	```
3. Install the node version that you want
	- `nvm ls-remote` to see the versions
	- `nvm install 9.2.0` to install the version
	- `nvm use 9.2.0` to use a specific version
	- `nvm current` to see the current version

4. run `node` in the console to open a python like console to run node comands

	- In the browser we have `window` that have all the variables and information, in node instead we have `global`
	- In the browser we have `document` that store a reference of the dom, in node there is no dom but we have `process` where we can see a lot of process that are being executed

5. run `process.exit(0);` to exit node console 

## Example

- Blocking

	```js
	var getUserSync = require('./getUserSync');

	var user1 = getUserSync('123');
	console.log("user1",user1);

	var user2 = getUserSync('321');
	console.log("user2",user2);

	var sum = 1 + 2
	console.log('the sum is ' + sum);
	```
	1. 3s waiting for user 1
	2. 0.1s printing user 1
	3. 3s waiting for user 2
	4. 0.1s printing user 2
	5. 0.1 printing sum
- non-Blocking
	- Event loop to make things faster
	- let us run one or more operations at the time 	
	```js

	var getUser = require('./getUser');

	getUser('123',function(user1){
		console.log("user1",user1);
	});
	getUser('321',function(user2){
		console.log("user2",user2);
	});

	var sum = 1 + 2
	console.log('the sum is ' + sum);
	```
	1. 0.1 Starting getuser for user 1
	5. 0.1 printing sum
	3. 0.1 Starting getuser for user 2
	2. wait-3s in parallel 0.1 printing user 1
	4. wait-3s in parallel 0.1 printing user 2
