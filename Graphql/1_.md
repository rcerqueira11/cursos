# Graphql

> Complete [code](https://github.com/StephenGrider/GraphQLCasts)

## Why does GraphQL exist?

### Problems
1. url schema with heavely nested issues
2. fetching heavely nested data (to many http request)
3. over serving data

## What is GraphQL?


## How do we use GraphQL
user -> friends -> company
- User, later friends asociated, finally find the company

```js
query {
  user(id: "23"){
    friends(){
      company{
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Starting app

GraphiQL <- GraphQL Query -> Express/GraphQL Server <-> Datastore

```sh
mkdir users
cd users
npm init
npm install --save express express-graphql graphql lodash

```

- express: incoming http request
- express-graphql: compatibility layer
- graphql:  grahpql library
- lodash: utility library

### how to make graphql and express work together

- request llega a express
- additional step examine the request if it is for graphql
- se lo envia a graphql
- graphql lo procesa
- graphql le envia la respuesta a express
- express envia el response

> Graphql its a descrete component in our app


## Schema

### Schema file

- Tell to graphql the type of data that we are working with
- How relations playout with all other pieces of data

### Root query
- Entry point into our app-data
- Jump and land in a very specific node

### Resolve function
- Connects to database
- Returns data from it

## Graphiql

- Investigate diferent queries on our app
- Documents Explorer to explore the schema

```js
{
  user(id: 23) {
    id,
    firstName,
    age
  }
}
```

## Diagram

- Graphql can serve as a proxy of source to go and fetch data from diferent sources, pull all data together and ship it back to our user

## JSON SERVER

- to create small api to serve some amount of data
- [DOCS](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

### Merge relations
- using the companyId capital I lowercase d
```json
{
  "users": [
    { "id": "23", "firstName": "Bill", "age": 20, "companyId": "1"},
    { "id": "40", "firstName": "Laura", "age": 21, "companyId": "2"},
    { "id": "47", "firstName": "Samantha", "age": 21, "companyId": "2"}
  ],
  "companies":[
    { "id": "1", "name": "Apple", "description": "iphone"},
    { "id": "2", "name": "Google", "description": "search"}
  ]
}
```
