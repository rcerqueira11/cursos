## Why does GraphQL exist?

### Problems
1. url schema with heavely nested issues
2. fetching heavely nested data (to many http request)
3. over serving data

## What is GraphQL?


## How do we use GraphQL
user -> friends -> company
- User, later friends asociated, finally find the company

```js
query {
  user(id: "23"){
    friends(){
      company{
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Starting app

GraphiQL <- GraphQL Query -> Express/GraphQL Server <-> Datastore

```sh
mkdir users
cd users
npm init
npm install --save express express-graphql graphql lodash

```

- express: incoming http request
- express-graphql: compatibility layer
- graphql:  grahpql library
- lodash: utility library

### how to make graphql and express work together

- request llega a express
- additional step examine the request if it is for graphql
- se lo envia a graphql
- graphql lo procesa
- graphql le envia la respuesta a express
- express envia el response

> Graphql its a descrete component in our app
