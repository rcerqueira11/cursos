## The Main Game 
- to test the state of the game is isolate you might render two copies of the same component is especially useful when you start working with a third-party state container like Redux for example.
- Having a top-level component like app component, when we need to completely reset the game. the easiest way to do so is to u  n-mount and re-mount it. The app component can help us there.
