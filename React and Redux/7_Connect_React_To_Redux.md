## Container vs Presentational Components

### Two Component Types

- presentational components are not tie to an specific behavior, it sbehavior is passed down from a container component via props 
- Container componente sis just a React coponent that uses store.subscribe to read part of the Redux state tree and supply props to child components

|**Container**|**Presentational**|
|--|--|
|Focus on how things work|Focus on how things look|
|Aware of Redux|Unawere of Redux (recive data and actions via props)|
|Subscribe to Redux State|Read data from props|
|Dispatch Redux Actions|Invoke callbacks on props (fire up actions by the callbascks passed down via props)|
|Generated by react-redux|Written by hand|

## React-redux introduction

- react-redux handles {store ->r react} in the flow
- react-redux ties your react components together with redux

|**Provider component**|**Connect component**|
|--|--|
| Attaches app to store| Creates container components|

### Provides component

- Attaches app to store
- is utilized at your aplication's root.
- wraps the entire application
- attaches the application to the redux store
- theorically you dont need to use the provider component 
- so provider make the store available to all your components automatically
- You only need to used once when you render your root the component 
```js
<Provider store={this.props.store}>
    <App/>
</Provider>
```
> `React's context: Useful for library authors. Dangerous for you.`

### Connect

- Creates container components
- wrap our component so its connected to the redux store
- connects your react component to the store so the functions is certainly named well 

```js
function mapStateToProps(state, ownProps){
    return {appState: state.authosReducer };
}
// pass connect two functions


export default connect(
    mapStateToProps, // specifies the state you want to expose to your component
    mapDispatchToProps // specifies the actions you want to expose
)(AuthorPage);
```
- in redux nearly all your components can be stateless functional componets if you'd like 

Benefits:
- No manual unsuscribe
- No lifecycle methods required
- Declare what subset of state you want 
- Enhanced performance for free ( your component only renders when the specific data you've connected changes)

## mapStateToProps

- useful for defining what part of Redux store you want to expose on your component
- when you define this function, the component will subscribe to redux store updates
- Any time it updates, mapStateToProps will be called 
- returns an object
- each property on the object you define will become a property on your container component 
- Determinates what state is available on your container component
