## What is docker?

- Lightweight, open, secure platform
- Simplify building, shipping, runnung apps
- Shipping container system for code
- Runs natively on Linux or Windows Server
- Runs on Windows or Mac Development machines (with a virtual machine)
- Relies on "images" and "containers"
- build int LXC 

## The Role of Images and Containers

### Image

- Used to build a container
- Will have the necessary files to run something on an operating system
- then you have your application framework on your database and then the files that support that
- if your r doing Node.js then you'd have that framework built into the image, as well as your app code 
- the image is just the definition
- think of it as the blueprint thats used to actually get a running container going 
- used to create a instance of a container

> A read-only template composed of layered filesystems used to share common files and create Docker container instances.

### Container

- created by using an image
- runs your application
- where the live app runs, or database or caching server

> An isolated and secured shipping container created from an image that can be run, started, stopped. moved and delete.

- the ship is our dev environment, staging environment, production environment
**Images create a instance of the running container**

## Where does docker run?

- Docker Client: commands that are given to the people that load theship or remove thing off the ship
- Docker Engine: could be the cranes, that get the container on the ship and up and running
