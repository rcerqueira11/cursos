## Redux

Action -> Store[ -> Reducer -> State]

### Action

An object that tells the reducer how to change its data
- give us the ability to make predictable changes to the state of out application
### Store

An object that holds the applications data

### Reducer

A function that returns some data

### State

Data for our app to use

## Provider

The store hold the state and the provider is the comunication from the store to the app provider[store] -> App


## Reach data from the store

`connect`: connect the component to redux store, by wrapping
  - connect the react side of the application to the redux store
- `export default connect()(LibraryList);` connect function returns another function which we pass the other param

- mapStateToProps: takes the global state, takes some properties of that global object and provide it as props to our component (LibraryList)
  - if we return an object from this it will show as a props to the component

```js
const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return { libraries: state.libraries}
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(LibraryList);
```

## Render big list of items

`ListView`: renders the component for the items in the screen and its behavior triggers when the user scrolls, to rearrenge the items

- FlatList: the one who renders only a subset of the items
  - `data`: the list of items
  - `renderItem`: function to reander out each of the items of the list
  - `keyExtractor`: we add a function to tell how generate its own key for each item
