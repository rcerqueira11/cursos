## Diferences React React-native

| React| React Native|
|--|---|
|knows how a component should behave|knows how to take the output from a component and place it on the scree|
|knows how to take a bunch of components and make then work together|provides default core components (image,text)|


## Creating app

- Only the 'root' component uses 'AppRegistry'
- Child we export it `export default Header`

We use nested components so in the index.js
- we import header `import Header from './src/components/header';`
- we includ it in the app component

## Style

- is done inside of the component
```
const styles = {
  textStyle: {
    fontSize:20
  }
}
```
> font-size in react is fontSize
- styles are done with camelcase

When we want to move info in the app we use the view tag
View tag works as the wrapping board

### Introduccion to flexbox

- css position technologie
- system to position elements whithing the container
- by default everything in react native gets positioned in the top left of the container

Property:
- justifyContent: to position elements in vertical direction [`flex-end`, `center`, `flex-start`]
  - flex-start is the default
- alignItems: position elements in the horizontal direction [`flex-end`, `center`, `flex-start`]

### Styling

- bottomBorder use shadow

### Pass data from parent to child

- we use props
- when using props we make a component more reusable

#### Stepts

1. Set the variable to be provided by the parent
```js
 <Text style={textStyle}>{props.headerText}</Text>
```
2. Reference to the props that comes from the parent component
```js
const Header = (props) => {
```
3. Make the parent component to provide the specific prop that the child is expecting
```js
<Header headerText={'Albums'}/>
```

## Clase based components and Functional components

### Functional Component

- Used for presenting static data
- Can't handle fetching data
- Easy to write

```js
constr Header = () =>{
  return <Text> Hi there! </Text>
}

```

### Class Component
- Used for dynamic source of data
- Handles any data that might change (fetchin data , user eventsm, etc)
- Know when it get erendered to the device( useful for data fetching)
- More code to write

```js
class Header extends Component {
  render() {
    return <Text> Hi there! </Text>
  }
}

```
- used when a large component require some helper methods
- requires a render

## Lifescycle methods

- placed in the class
- when is called in component will mount

```js
class AlbumList extends Component {
  componentWillMount() {
      axios.get('http://rallycoding.herokuapp.com/api/music_albums')
        .then(response => console.log(JSON.stringify(response)))
    }
  ...
}
```

## Debugger

- debug js remotely in the phone `http://192.168.1.151:19001/debugger-ui/` get you to this dir
- you can set `debugger` too

## State is how react handles the content that its show on the screen

state = {alumbs []}
state = {alumbs [{name: 'asd'},{name: 'qwe'}]}

- when we change the state it automatic renders
fetch state

1. set initial state for component
  - class level property `state= {};`
  ```js
    state = {
      albums: []
    };
  ```

2. tell our component state to update when we fetch the data
  - take the data
  - update the component state
  - setState: we have new data we have to render
  ```js
    componentWillMount() {
      axios.get('http://rallycoding.herokuapp.com/api/music_albums')
        .then(response => this.setState({ albums: response.data}))
    }
  ```
3. make sure our component make use of the state


## Rules of state

- Definition: a plain javascript object used to record and resopnse to user-triggered events

- when we need to update what a component show, call  `this.setState`

- Only change state with 'setState', do not do `this.state`

**Props** : for parents to child communitcatio
**State** : for components internal record keeping
  - state is just used with class base components

### have unique "key" prop
- add key to text <Text key={album.title}>{album.title}</Text>
- best key is the id of the object of the resource

## FlexBox

- `justifyContent: 'space-between'` : the container will maximize and equalize the amount of space between each item (ther first item is in the top and the last item in the bottom)

- `justifyContent: 'space-around'` : the container will maximize and equalize the amount of space between each item (the first item is separated from the top and the last item is separated form the bottom )

### Flex direction

flex justify rule can be applied to vertical and horizontal elements, this is set by `flexDirection`

- vertical: `flexDirection: 'column'`
- horizontal: `flexDirection: 'row'`


## Full image streach from right to left
```js
imageStyle:{
  height: 300,
  flex: 1,
  width: null
}
```

## Scroll

- default is not scroll
Steps

1. Indentify the jsx that we expect to be scrollable
2. Import react component scrollview

```js
<ScrollView>
  {this.renderAlbums()}
</ScrollView>
```

- must add a style of flex 1 to the root component
```js
 <View style={{ flex: 1}}>
  <Header headerText={'Albums List'}/>
  <AlbumList />

</View>
```

  - what is say is please expand this component to the entire width of the device
