## Diferences React React-native

| React| React Native|
|--|---|
|knows how a component should behave|knows how to take the output from a component and place it on the scree|
|knows how to take a bunch of components and make then work together|provides default core components (image,text)|


## Creating app

- Only the 'root' component uses 'AppRegistry'
- Child we export it `export default Header`

We use nested components so in the index.js
- we import header `import Header from './src/components/header';`
- we includ it in the app component

## Style

- is done inside of the component
```
const styles = {
  textStyle: {
    fontSize:20
  }
}
```
> font-size in react is fontSize
- styles are done with camelcase

When we want to move info in the app we use the view tag
View tag works as the wrapping board

### Introduccion to flexbox

- css position technologie
- system to position elements whithing the container
- by default everything in react native gets positioned in the top left of the container

Property:
- justifyContent: to position elements in vertical direction [`flex-end`, `center`, `flex-start`]
  - flex-start is the default
- alignItems: position elements in the horizontal direction [`flex-end`, `center`, `flex-start`]

### Styling

- bottomBorder use shadow

### Pass data from parent to child

- we use props
- when using props we make a component more reusable

#### Stepts

1. Set the variable to be provided by the parent
```js
 <Text style={textStyle}>{props.headerText}</Text>
```
2. Reference to the props that comes from the parent component
```js
const Header = (props) => {
```
3. Make the parent component to provide the specific prop that the child is expecting
```js
<Header headerText={'Albums'}/>
```

## Clase based components and Functional components

### Functional Component

- Used for presenting static data
- Can't handle fetching data
- Easy to write

```js
constr Header = () =>{
  return <Text> Hi there! </Text>
}

```

### Class Component
- Used for dynamic source of data
- Handles any data that might change (fetchin data , user eventsm, etc)
- Know when it get erendered to the device( useful for data fetching)
- More code to write

```js
class Header extends Component {
  render() {
    return <Text> Hi there! </Text>
  }
}

```
- used when a large component require some helper methods
- requires a render

## Lifescycle methods

- placed in the class
- when is called in component will mount

## Debugger

- debug js remotely in the phone `http://192.168.1.151:19001/debugger-ui/` get you to this dir
- you can set `debugger` too
